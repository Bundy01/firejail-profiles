Tight Firejail profiles

This is a collection of tighter firejail (https://github.com/netblue30/firejail) profiles for certain applications. These may or may not work on your computer since some of them use seccomp filters, which may depend on architecture and OS. These were designed on Debian sid/experimental x86_64.

I am slowly switching the profiles to use a `common.inc` file so that maintenance becomes easier and I cut down on duplicate stuff.

Just a note: I would highly recommend using `systemd` to sandbox system processes. I personally do not use `firejail` to sandbox system processes since I'm using `systemd` to start the process anyway (so it's easier to use the sandboxing capabilities of `systemd` itself).

## Utilities

Currently there is one utility file in this repository: `gen_libraries`. `gen_libraries` is a collection of `bash` functions which helps dynamically resolve the libraries needed by a program in a more powerful way than the built-in one shipped with `firejail`. Most pertinently, it allows passing a folder as the first argument, in which case it will use `find` to locate all files within the folder and run `ldd` on each of them. This makes it easier, say, to compile a list for `firefox`.

An example script, `firefox.common`, which makes use of `gen_libraries` is provided in this repository as well. You should edit `$FXLIBDIR` and `$GENLIB` to point to your `firefox` lib directory (defaults to `/usr/lib/firefox`) and the `gen_libraries` script (default `~/scripts/gen_libraries`) or disable `private-lib` generation by setting `$PRIVLIB` to `0`. The script has the following features:

* It can simply load a profile (pass the path to the profile as the first argument and `0` as the second and third arguments).
* It can create a temporary profile which is completely empty (pass the path to any profile as the first argument, `1` as the second argument, and `0` as the third argument).
* It can create a temporary profile and copy over files from another profile (pass the path to the profile which you wish to copy files from as the first argument and `1` as the second and third arguments). You can edit the list of files and folders to be copied over by editing the `$TOCOPY` variable.

You can disable the `systemd` specific parts of the script by setting `$USE_SYSTEMD` to `0`. You may also need to edit the list of additional libraries (the second argument to `compile_list`), since that list is what works for me on my system but may not be enough on yours.

Another example script, `dropbox`, is also provided which uses `gen_libraries` to dynamically generate the library dependencies needed to get `dropbox` working with a `private-lib` filter.

Yet another example script, `google-earth-pro`, is provided which uses `gen_libraries` to dynamically generate the library dependencies needed to get `google-earth-pro` working with a `private-lib` filter. Also note that due to some issues with `google-earth-pro`, the script manually removes the lock file generated by Google Earth after quitting.
